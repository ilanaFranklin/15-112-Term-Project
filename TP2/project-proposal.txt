 Term Project Proposal
 Ilana Franklin (inf), Section G
########################################
 My term project will be a simple game in which you play a spider climbing to the top of a tree. The tree will be recursively generated, and the spider will start at one
of the lower branches. The goal is to reach the top of the tree by drawing webs, however, you have a limited amount of web. To get more web, you have to catch bugs. The
webs that you draw will also follow physics and react to things like wind speed and collision with bugs.

The tone of the game will be calm and relaxing, not fast paced. Animations will be minimalist.
Additionally, the sky will change colors according to time passing in the game.

The most challenging parts of this project will algorithms for generation of the
tree, and coding the physics of the web. I have already finished with web physics,
as shown in draw-rope.py
