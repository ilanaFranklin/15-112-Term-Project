ARACHNOPHILIA: THE SPIDER WEB GAME

Very similar to my idea, but is much more fast paced.

Similarities:
    - Drag mouse to draw web
    - Catch bugs
    - Limited amount of web, must catch bugs to build more web
    - Spider can climb across webs

Differences:
    - My game will be much more simplistic in terms of graphics (only silhouettes)
    - Drawn webs will actually follow physics (reacting to wind, bugs, etc.)
    - Pace of the game will be relaxed and much slower, I want the game to be
      more like Hermit in terms of a calm tone
    - Time will pass in my game (sky changes colors)
    - Goal is to get to the top of the tree, not survive as long as possible

Overall, my game will be much more calm in tone. Additionally, the tree that
you climb will be randomly generated every game, instead of just one frame of
branches that is the same every time.


This is the most similar game that I could find to my own. Nothing else I could
find online was really reflective of my game at all. Other games involving spiders
that I could find didn't have much to do with drawing webs or physics. Therefore
